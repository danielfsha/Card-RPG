# Protocol Omega

**Current Year**: 3042 AD  
**Location**: Aethelgard System, Outer Rim  
**Status**: Besieged

## The Story

The **Voidborn**, a silicon-based hive mind, have breached the Aethelgard blockade. Their fleets darken the skies of **Celestia**, the last stronghold of humanity in the sector. Traditional weapons are useless against their shifting phase-shields.

Only one defense remains: The **Stellar Core**, an ancient reality-warping engine powered by the **10 Archetypes** of consciousness.

### The Protagonists

You play as one of two elite "Ciphers" — pilots capable of synchronizing with the Core's logic gates:

- **Commander Kael**: A battle-hardened tactician who believes in overwhelming force (High ATK strategies).
- **Specialist Lyra**: A cryptographer who manipulates probability and time (Effect/Control strategies).

### The Objective

To activate the Stellar Core and repel the invasion, Kael and Lyra must engage in the **Trials of the Draw**. They must synchronize the Core's unstable energy outputs (Combat Cards) without overloading the system (Busting).

## The Game

**Stellar Duel** (based on the archives of "Dead Man's Draw") is the interface for this synchronization.

- **The Deck**: Represents the Core's available energy signatures.
- **Play Area**: The Stabilization Field.
- **Bust**: A system overload caused by conflicting energy frequencies (matching Suits).
- **Winning**: Successfully channeling enough energy (LP damage) to the Voidborn flagship to destroy it.

## Zero-Knowledge Security

The Voidborn are constantly listening. They can intercept any standard transmission.

We use **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** to coordinate our strikes. When you draw a weapon from the Core, the ZK circuit proves its validity to the network _without revealing the frequency to the Voidborn_ until the moment of impact.
