# Stellar Game Studio ZK

Welcome to the documentation for the **Zero-Knowledge adaptation** of our game platform. This project explores the intersection of high-stakes card gaming and cryptographic privacy.

## Project Overview

We are building a **Yu-Gi-Oh! inspired** battle card game that integrates the risk-management mechanics of **Dead Man's Draw**.

### Why Zero-Knowledge?

In traditional digital card games (like Hearthstone or Master Duel), the game server knows your entire deck and hand. It is a trusted third party.

In a decentralized environment, we have two bad options:

1.  **Commit-Reveal**: Hash your move. Reveal it later. (Slow, bad UX for "Push Your Luck").
2.  **Trusted Server**: Defeats the point of decentralization.

**ZK Proofs** allow us to have the best of both worlds:

- **Instant Verification**: Prove a move is valid immediately.
- **Total Privacy**: The opponent (and the blockchain) verify the _validity_ of the move without seeing the _data_ (the cards).
