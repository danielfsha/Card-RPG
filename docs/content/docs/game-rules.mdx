# Game Rules

This project combines the strategic card combat of **Yu-Gi-Oh!** with the push-your-luck mechanics of **Dead Man's Draw**, all powered by Zero-Knowledge proofs for trustless play.

## Core Objective

Reduce your opponent's Life Points (LP) to 0. Players achieve this by summoning monsters, activating traits, and managing the risk of "busting" during their Draw Phase.

## Deck Construction

- **Deck Size**: 40-60 cards.
- **Card Types**: Monsters only (Traits serve as logic).
- **Suits**: 10 distinct Suits (based on Dead Man's Draw types, mapped to Yu-Gi-Oh archetypes).
- **Commitment**: The entire deck is committed as a Merkle Tree at the start of the game. Order cannot be changed.

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of three main phases:

### 1. Draw Phase (Push-Your-Luck)

The active player draws cards from their deck one by one into the **Play Area**.

- **Success**: If the drawn card's suit has **not** appeared in the Play Area this turn, the draw is successful.
- **Bank**: The player can choose to "Stop" at any time, moving all cards from the Play Area to their **Hand** or **Field** (depending on Summoning rules).
- **Bust**: If a drawn card matches a suit already in the Play Area, the player **Busts**. The turn ends immediately, and all drawn cards are discarded to the Graveyard.

### 2. Main Phase (Summoning)

If the player successfully banked their cards, they can perform actions:

- **Normal Summon**: Summon 1 monster from hand (or Play Area bank). Level 5+ requires Tributes.
- **Special Summon**: Activate Traits (e.g., Mermaid) to swarm the field.
- **Activate Effects**: Use card traits (e.g., Cannon destroys a card).

### 3. Battle Phase

- Attack opponent's monsters or directly if they have none.
- **Damage Calculation**: Standard ATK vs DEF or ATK vs ATK.
- **Atomic Resolution**: ZK proofs verify the math without revealing the exact stats of hidden cards until the battle resolves.

## Special Mechanics

### The "Bust" Factor in ZK

In a traditional physical game, a bust is visible. In this ZK version:

- The player generates a proof that they _drew_ a card.
- The proof output includes a flag `isBust`.
- If `isBust` is true, the smart contract enforces the turn end penalty.
- The specific card causing the bust stays hidden unless strategic rules require revelation, but typically only the _fact_ of the bust is proven.

### Traits (Suit Abilities)

Based on Dead Man's Draw suits, adapted:
| DMD Suit | Effect | YGO Adaptation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cannon** | Destroy 1 card | Destruction Effect (field target) |
| **Sword** | Steal a card | Change of Heart / Snatch Steal |
| **Map** | Draw from discard | Monster Reborn (Graveyard recure) |
| **Oracle** | See next card | Topdeck manipulation / Peeking |
| **Key** | Double rewards | Double Damage / Battle Damage x2 |
| **Chest** | Points multiplier | LP Gain / Banking mechanic |
| **Kraken** | Forced draw | Forced "Push Your Luck" (must draw 2 more) |
| **Mermaid** | Score modifiers | Level manipulation / Tuning |
| **Hook** | Retrieve card | Search deck / Add to hand |
| **Anchor** | Save cards | Protection from Destruction |

## Winning

- **Deplete LP**: Reduce opponent to 0 LP.
- **Deck Out**: Opponent cannot draw.
- **Exodia Condition**: Bank all 10 unique suits in a single turn (Instant Win).
