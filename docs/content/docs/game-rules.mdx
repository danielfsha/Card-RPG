# Game Rules

This project combines the strategic card combat of **Stellar Duel** (Yu-Gi-Oh! mechanics) with the push-your-luck mechanics of **Etherion**, all powered by Zero-Knowledge proofs for trustless play.

## Card Anatomy (Spectral Champions)

Unlike standard playing cards, every unit in Etherion is a **Spectral Champion** with distinct battle stats and abilities.

### Structure

Each card contains verifiable metadata used in ZK circuits:

1.  **Name & Rank**: Determines the Level (1-12) and Tributes required (Rank 5+ requires 1 Tribute).
2.  **Archetype (Suit)**: The primary family (Valor, Harbor, Fury, etc.) which determines the "Bust" condition.
3.  **ATK/DEF**: Combat values for the Battle Phase.
4.  **Attribute & Type**: Elemental affinity (Fire, Water) and species (Dragon, Machine) for synergy checks.
5.  **Trait Effect**: A unique scriptable ability (e.g., "Steal 1 Monster") verified by the game engine.

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of three main phases:

### 1. Nexus Phase (Draw & Push-Your-Luck)

The active player draws Champions from their **Ether Deck** into the **Nexus Zone** (Play Area).

- **Resonance**: If the drawn Champion's Archetype (Suit) is **new** to the Nexus this turn, the draw is successful.
- **Bank**: The player can stop to move cards to Hand/Field.
- **Dissonance (Bust)**: If the Archetype matches one already in the Nexus, the feedback loop causes a **Dissonance**. Turn ends, cards sent to Void.

### 2. Main Phase (Summoning)

- **Normal Summon**: 1 per turn from Hand/Bank.
- **Special Summon**: Via card effects (e.g., _Voidblade Apex_ Synchro Summon).
- **Activate Spells**: Use Trait Cards or "Trait Curses" (Spells/Traps) set in previous turns.

### 3. Battle Phase

- **Attack**: Target enemy Champions.
- **Damage**: Calculated as `|ATK - DEF|` or `|ATK - ATK|`.
- **Destruction**: Lower stat loses. ZK proof confirms the winner without revealing the loser's exact stat if it remains hidden contextually (e.g. defense position flip).

## Winning Conditions

1.  **Life Point Depletion**: Opponent reaches 0 LP.
2.  **Deckout**: Opponent cannot draw.
3.  **Exodia Protocol**: Bank 10 Unique Archetypes in one Nexus Phase.
