# Game Rules

This project combines the strategic card combat of **Stellar Duel** (Yu-Gi-Oh! mechanics) with the push-your-luck mechanics of **Protocol Omega**, all powered by Zero-Knowledge proofs for trustless play.

## Core Objective

Reduce the Voidborn's Life Points (HP) to 0. Players achieve this by summoning constructs (Monsters), activating artifacts (Traits), and managing the risk of "System Overload" (Busting) during their Draw Phase.

## Deck Construction

- **Deck Size**: 40-60 cards.
- **Card Types**: Constructs only (Traits serve as logic).
- **Artifacts (Suits)**: 10 distinct frequencies.
- **Commitment**: The entire deck is committed as a Merkle Tree at the start of the game. Order cannot be changed.

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of three main phases:

### 1. Synchronization Phase (Draw Validation)
The active Pilot draws cards from their Core Deck one by one into the **Stabilization Field** (Play Area).

- **Success**: If the drawn card's Artifact type has **not** appeared in the Field this turn, the draw is successful.
- **Bank**: The Pilot can choose to "Stop" at any time, moving all cards from the Field to their **Hand** or **Zone** (depending on Summoning rules).
- **Overload (Bust)**: If a drawn card matches an Artifact already in the Field, the system **Overloads**. The turn ends immediately, and all drawn cards are flushed to the Void (Graveyard).

### 2. Main Phase (Deployment)
If the Pilot successfully banked their cards, they can perform actions:
- **Normal Deploy**: Summon 1 construct from hand. Level 5+ requires Tributes.
- **Special Deploy**: Activate Artifact Traits (e.g., Mermaid AI) to swarm the field.
- **Activate Effects**: Use card traits (e.g., Plasma Cannon destroys a card).

### 3. Battle Phase
- Attack opponent's constructs or directly if they have none.
- **Damage Calculation**: Standard ATK vs DEF or ATK vs ATK.
- **Atomic Resolution**: ZK proofs verify the math without revealing the exact stats of hidden cards until the battle resolves.

## Special Mechanics

### The "Overload" Factor in ZK
In a traditional physical game, a bust is visible. In this ZK version:
- The Pilot generates a proof that they *drew* a card.
- The proof output includes a flag `isOverload`.
- If `isOverload` is true, the smart contract enforces the turn end penalty.
- The specific card causing the overload stays hidden unless strategic rules require revelation.

### Artifacts (Suits)
Based on Dead Man's Draw suits, adapted to the Stellar Core protocol:

| Archive Code | Artifact | Effect | Tactical Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0x01** | **Plasma Cannon** | Destroy 1 target | Clear enemy defenses. |
| **0x02** | **Phase Sword** | Steal opponent card | Use their assets against them. |
| **0x03** | **Star Map** | Retrieve from Void | Recursion/Revival. |
| **0x04** | **Oracle Sensor** | Predict next card | Risk management. |
| **0x05** | **Master Key** | Double rewards | Amplifier. |
| **0x06** | **Void Chest** | Points multiplier | Life Point gain. |
| **0x07** | **Kraken Drive** | Forced draw | Offensive pressure (force bust). |
| **0x08** | **Mermaid AI** | Score modifier | Synchro/Tuning. |
| **0x09** | **Grapple Hook** | Search deck | Persistence. |
| **0x0A** | **Shield Anchor** | Prevent destruction | Protection. |

## Winning
- **Deplete HP**: Reduce Voidborn HP to 0.
- **System Lock**: Force the opponent into a state where they cannot draw.
- **Protocol Exodia**: Trigger the Stellar Core by banking all 10 artifacts in one turn.
